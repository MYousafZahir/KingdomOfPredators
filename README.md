If you're reading this README locally, I would recommend viewing it using MarkText, as that's what it was written on.

## About

Kingdom of Predators is an ecosystem simulator made with Unreal Engine with the purpose of exploring the usage of emergence based agents in making believeable creatures for 3D worlds. 
Specifically, the movement of the creatures from a top-down view should, at a glance, look believeable.

Kingdom of Predators doesn't assign creatures roles within the ecosystem, rather it assign each creature different values for its attributes and affinities, 
which are passed down through mating. These attribute and affinity values are the only things used to differentiate how this creature will interact with its environment compared to other creatures.
Apart from these attributes and affinities, the creatures use their ability of sight and 'intuition' to move and roam around. 

## Features

### Sight Visualization

A simple, easy-to-use check box to toggle the creatures sight visualization on and off. To use, run the simulation, press SHIFT + F1 to use your mouse and click the check box.
